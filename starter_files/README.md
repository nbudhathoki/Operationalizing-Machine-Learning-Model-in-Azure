# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure- Bank Marketing Campaigns Dataset

This dataset contains marketing campaigns of a bank in which we can analyze the data , and build some predictive models to find new strategic ways to improve the future marketing campaigns, and target the right customers. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

The goal of this project is to use the Azure ML tools to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a ML pipeline in Azure.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
